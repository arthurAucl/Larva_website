        <h3>Runtime Verification</h3>
        <p>Robustness and reliability are key factors in the success of the deployment of security-critical systems. Testing, fails to address these concerns adequately since not all possible execution paths are covered. On the other hand, verification -
            the analysis of all execution paths - is usually unfeasible due to the large state space of such systems. Runtime-verification addresses the issue by enabling formal verification of the system during its execution. An adequate logic and language
            to express typical security properties is a prerequisite to enable runtime verification.</p>

        <h3>LARVA</h3>
        <p>LARVA is a runtime verification platform for runtime verification of critical systems. A language was specifically designed to allow a user to specify the security properties of a JAVA software system. Once these are specified in a text file,
            the compiler generates the necessary code in JAVA and AspectJ which verifies that the properties in the script are being adhered to during the execution of the system. The advantage of taking this approach is that the monitoring is done without
            changing any code in the system being monitored.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-centralisation">
        <h3>Centralisation</h3>
        <p>Security properties can be specified separately in one central location and outside of the system code with the possibility of easily turning on or off this extra checking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-different-uses">
        <h3>Different uses</h3>
        <p>LARVA use can either be limited during the testing phase or else it can be used also after deployment. The latter has the advantage of reassuring that under no circumstance will any of the security properties be violated. However, this also has
            the disadvantage of adding extra overhead to the system.</p>
